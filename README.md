# DomainCollector

This script is used to web scrape domains of results for a google search. 

To use the script, ensure you have Google custom search engine CSE_ID and a Google API key in a .env file.

Then run:

```bash
    main.py
```

This would run the script. It would ask you for a keyword, then process the keyword and save the result to a spreadsheet locally.
